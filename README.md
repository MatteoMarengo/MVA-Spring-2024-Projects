# MVA-Spring-2024-Deep-Learning-Medical-Imaging

This repository contains the work done for the course <b>Deep Learning for medical imaging</b> given by O. COLLIOT (CNRS) and M. VAKALOPOULOU (CentraleSupelec) for the MVA Master, during the spring semester 2024.

## Project 1 - Article Report and Poster

- The first project countains the review and the poster of the article [Analyzing components of a transformer under different dataset scales in 3D prostate CT segmentation](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/12464/1246408/Analyzing-components-of-a-transformer-under-different-dataset-scales-in/10.1117/12.2651572.short)

## Project 2 - Challenge

- The second project is a challenge to classify lymphocytosis. This two-month challenge highlighted the complexities of working with medical data, particularly due to issues such as imbalanced datasets and limited data availability. Leveraging both imaging and clinical data, we developed and assessed a <b>Multi-Instance Learning pipeline</b> designed to classify patients based on their type of lymphocytosis. Our efforts focused on optimizing feature extraction, ensuring balanced training, and effectively aggregating embeddings to improve classification accuracy.
